# Survival

In this module you will learn how to inspect data and analyze data from different fields of biology. One of the challenges is to find the information you need yourself. You will have to use a library for data visualization called Seaborn. At every exercise you should try to find in the documentation which function to use and how to use it. First you will learn how to use a library called `Pandas` to read and manipulate data. Then you will learn to use `Seaborn` to inspect the data. All further reading is contained witin the notebooks of the exercises.
