# Jupyter notebooks

For this assignment there will be a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/)
which you should use to answer some short questions about the material. These
notebooks allow a mixture of nicely formatted text, *Python* code and some
tests. 

Download the notebook file [here](/complexity/downloads/module_5_questions.ipynb).

There will be some short questions for every section of the assignment in the
notebook. For now you'll only have to do the questions on the *efficiency*
section.

After completing every section, answer the question in this notebook and check
your answers, before moving on to the next section.

## Getting started

In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you placed the file for the assignment and run the command
    
    jupyter notebook

This will print some information about the *Notebook* server in your console, and open a web browser to the URL of the web application. By defaut this is [http://127.0.0.1:8888](http://127.0.0.1:8888). Note that *127.0.0.1* is the home ip-adress, so this is now a webpage running on your own computer!

This first page shows the dashboard, which lists the notebooks available in the current directory. You can create new notebooks from the dashboard with the `New` button (select *Python 3* notebook), or open existing ones. Creating a new notebook will create a new file `Untitled1.ipynb`. The extension `.ipynb` indicates it is a notebook file, you can rename the file to something more descriptive at the top of the page.

Now open the downloaded notebook *module_5_questions.ipynb* and continue with
the assignment there. Start by reading the part about *notebook cells* and
*markdown* there.
